Rendering an image is basically a **sampling process**: a continuous image, described with its geometry, colors, and lighting, 
has to be sampled and turned into pixels on the screen. These notes are a quick intro to signal processing and how it works in computer graphics. 
Weâ€™ll go through signals, sampling, filtering, and then talk about some anti-aliasing algorithms, including an example on ShaderToy.
