**How to use interactive content on this blog.**

{{% notice info "Info" %}}
In this short guide, we'll explore how to interact with the content on this website. Shaders will be often written with [Shadertoy](https://shadertoy.com/ "ShaderToy") and function graphs plotted with [Desmos](https://desmos.com/ "Desmos").

## ShaderToy

A **Shadertoy shaders** is a shader written on [Shadertoy](https://shadertoy.com/) using the GLSL language.
When you **hover** over the shader image, a minimal interface will apper. Clicking on the **play button** will start the shader, if it's not already in play state. 
Some shader are interactive and respond to inputs from the mouse or the keyboard.

Clicking on the **title** at the top of the shader will redirect you to a page 
where you can **modify the code in real time**. Feel free to play with all the shaders, make modifications and see the results.

## Desmos

A **Desmos graph**: is an interactive graph that plots one or more mathematical functions that you can modify b rewriting them in the box on the left.
