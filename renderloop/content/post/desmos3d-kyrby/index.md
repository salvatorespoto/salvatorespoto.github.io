### 3D Modelins with Math for Fun.
Desmos recently added 3D graphing functionalities, so I had fun modeling Kirby with some stars around him. 
This was obviously inspired by the incredible work of [Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org), who is renowned for his exceptional math modeling, 
especially on Shadertoy. You can check out an example of his amazing work [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8--5LwHRhjk).

For this scene, I mainly used distorted ellipsoids, both implicit and explicit. 
I found that implicit shapes are easier to blend smoothly. I then added some stars using a math function specifically for that, which only requires a few parameter settings.

Hereâ€™s the result (it takes some seconds to render ;):
